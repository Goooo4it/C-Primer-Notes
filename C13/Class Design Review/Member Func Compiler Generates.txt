# Defualt constructor

A defualt constructor is one that has no argument, or else one for which all the arguments have default arguments.
If you don't define any constructor, the compiler defines a default constructor for you.

If you define a constructor of any kind, the compiler does not define a default constructor for you. In that case, it's up to you to provide a default constructor if one is needed.

# Copy constructor

A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the class type as its argument. Typically, the declared parameter is a constant reference to the class type. The copy constructor has the prototype:

`ClassName(const ClassName &)`

A class copy constructor is used in the following situation
1. When a new object is initialized to an object of the same class
2. When an object is passed to a function by value
3. When a function returns an object by value
4. When the compiler generates a temporary object

If the program does not have a copy constructor, the compiler defines a copy constructor that performs memberwise initialization. In some case, memberwise initialization is not desirable. For example, when member pointers initialized with `new` generally require that you institute deep copying. Or a class may have a static variable that needs to be modified.

# Assigment operators 

Difference between assignment and initialization: If a statement creates a new object, it's using initialization, and if a statement alters the value of an existing object, it's assignment.

Defualt assignment uses memberwise assignment. If you need to define copy constructor explicit, you also need to define the assignment operator explicitly. The protype for a class `ClassName` assignment is

`ClassName & ClassName::operator=(const ClassName &);`

The compiler does not generate assignment operators for assigning one type to another. Suppose you want to be able to assign a string to a `Star` object. One opproach is to define such an operator explicitly

`Star & Star::operator=(const char *);`

Another approach is to use a conversion function to convert a string to a `Star` object and then use the `Star-to-Star` assignment.
