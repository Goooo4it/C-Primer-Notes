C++ provide the following types of conversions for class:

1. A class constructor that has but a single argument serves as an instruction for converting a value of the argument
type to the class type. However, using `explicit` in the constructor declaration eliminates implicit conversions and
allows only explicit conversions.

2. A special class member operator function called a `conversion function` serves as an instruction for converting 
a class object to some other type. THe conversion function is a class member, has no declared return type, has no 
argument, and is called `operator TypeName()`, where `TypeName` is the type to which the object is to be converted.
This conversion function is invoked automatically when you assign a class object to a variable of that type or use 
the type cast operator to that type.
