1. If use `new` to initialize a pointer member in a constructor, should use delete in the destructor
2. The uses of `new` and `delete` should be compatible. Should pair `new` with `delete` and `new []` with `delete []`.
3. If there are multiple constructors, should use `new` the same way - either all with brackets or all without brackets.
4. SHould define a copy constructor that initializes one obejct to another by doing deep copying.
```
String::String(const String & st) {
    num_strings++;
    len = st.len;
    str = new char[len + 1];
    std::strcpy(str, st.str);
}
```
5. Should define an assignment operator that copies one object to another by doing deep copying. 
```
String & String::operator=(const String & st) {
    if (this == &st) {
        return *this;
    }
    delete []
     str;
    len = st.len;
    str = new char[len + 1];
    std::strcpy(str, st.str);
    return *this;
}
```
